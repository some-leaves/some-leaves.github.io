<h3><strong><em><body> Our Mission</body></em></strong></h3>

<p> We six girls believe that we can shrink the level of ignorance that has a firm grip on society today can change. Everyone is equal no one should be treated as more or less than a living being.
 This isn’t just a website, this is a glimpse into how our universe can become better not only as a body but as individuals. Where we help you figure out why Sexism, Racism, and Homophobia are three barriers keeping america from having peace & progression as a nation. We want to bring to your attention and emphasize our personal experience and factual evidence of what this society has really come to. We’re all here as advocates for those who feel as if their voice has been silenced. We will stand for what is right,  and protest for what’s inhumane. To us, its more than equity- it’s respect. Any news we missed or a story you’d like to share that you believe your voice has a right be heard and could possibly help another individual? Email us!</p>
