       Hi! I'm 16 and I am from Chicago.
       My mission is to make people understand the gravity of discrimination
        and how it can hurt people. I want the new generation to grow up
        in positivity and love and not have to get The Talk from their parents
        about how people won't like them because the color of their skin or who
        they are. Yeah so this is inspiring.<br><br><br></h1></center></div>

    Wassup, I'm 16 and from Chicago. Being able to inform others on the consequences of
     their so called "jokes", minor comments or actions on topics such as these will make me feel as
     though I'm giving back to make sure our communities become more of a concrete establishment of
     equity and peace. <br><br><br></h3></center></div>

      Hey. I am a 16 year old female. I am passionate about this project because I believe that
      ignorance is dangerous. I have never faced direct discrimination but routinely have to get
      into heated conversations explaining to people why the things they consider "facts" are wrong.<br><br><br></h4></center></div>

  <div class="parallax5"><h5><br><br><br><u><strong>Sophie</u><br>
    Hi there! I'm 17 years old, and I live in the suburbs about an hour out from Chicago.
    Although I'm white and was raised in more of a sheltered community, the friends I have grown
    up with have been a major part of my drive to raise awareness for social issues that our society
    has worked to erase from the public.<br><br><br></h5></center></strong></div>

  <div class="parallax6"><h6><br><br><br><u>Jessica</u><br>
      Hi! I'm a 17 year old Mexican girl. When I was younger, I was never really aware of the type
      of discrimination that existed towards Hispanics and other people of color. As I grew older I
      realized people viewed us differently. Although I never faced direct discrimination, the
      discrimination that my people receives hurts me. UHHHHHH<br><br><br></h6></center></div>
