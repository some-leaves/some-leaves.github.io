    Hi! I`m 16 and I am from Chicago.
    My mission is to make people understand the gravity of discrimination
     and how it can hurt people. I want the new generation to grow up
     in positivity and love and not have to get The Talk from their parents
     about how people won`t like them because the color of their skin or who
     they are. Yeah so this is inspiring.</h2>

     equity and peace. </h4>
