<h3>What is Racial Discrimination?</h3>
<p>A straightforward definition of racial discrimination is the process of discrimination towards a specific group of individuals based on their race. Discrimination alone means “the unjust or prejudicial treatment of different” groups of individuals. It is unfair, cruel, and inhumane. <em>It needs to stop.</em></p>
<h3>Where is this Problem Coming From?</h3>
<p>A whopping 72 percent of Americans think that racial discrimination against blacks is a serious problem in this country. While 89 percent of blacks and 81 percent of Hispanics share that sentiment, roughly 68 percent of whites said it’s a serious problem and 30 percent said it’s not a serious problem, believing that we have done all necessary actions in order to to achieve racial equality. In terms of politics, 81% of Democrats believe the country has yet to continue improving, unlike the 59% of Republicans believe that this country has done enough for its POC. Racial discrimination has less to do with politics though, it has to do with society as a whole and the way our perspectives have been negatively altered in the past. We as a society have to work as a whole to eliminate the existing racial bias and discrimination.</p>
<h3>How Can This Problem Be Fixed?</h3>
<p>Bias is inevitable, everyone is bound to have a sort of bias but there is a difference between having a bias or opinion about something and being completely disrespectful and cruel. The first step to fixing a problem is acknowledging it exists, that is what separates those who are woke and those who are ignorant. We will always have those people who are selfish and believe that their beliefs are the only truth but the more people that are aware of problems that exist in terms of racial discrimination, we can progress as a whole. There will always be negativity, or else we won’t have positivity, but it is possible to make this world a better place for everyone inclusively.</p>
